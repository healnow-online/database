# database
This is a structured database of our content.

The short description is that every sentence we say, "Claim", has a reference behind it, a "Reference", be it to an internal page or (mostly) to external pages with scientific research.


## implementation

It was created from the 'database' folder from Github project "fullstack-laravel-vuejs" (https://github.com/gabipetrovay/fullstack-laravel-vuejs). 

Since there is layered information, it's not as simple as a single data.json file. It has references to other .json's.

## TODO

Verify the database structure.
Interface it with healnow.online to render the content.
